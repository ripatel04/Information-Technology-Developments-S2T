Project Description 

Share2Teach is an open educational resource (OER) platform aimed at creating a global community of educators and learners. Built to foster collaboration and self-directed learning, the platform provides features such as secure account creation, file uploading, moderation, tagging, and a powerful search functionality. Users can contribute educational materials, rate resources, and access analytics to monitor engagement, all while ensuring document security with automated watermarks and licensing.

This project extends the Share2Teach platform by integrating enhanced user roles (Admins, Moderators, Educators, and Open Access Users) and a robust backend infrastructure. With a focus on accessibility and scalability, the system is built as a responsive web app supported by secure APIs, SQL-based data storage, and modern authentication methods like JWTs. The platform is a collaborative effort to democratize education by breaking barriers and encouraging global participation.
